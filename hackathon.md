## Hackathon Rules

To keep things fair and aligned with our goals, all teams must follow these rules:

1. **MongoDB Atlas Requirement for Finalists**: Teams selected as finalists must use MongoDB Atlas as part of their project. Projects that do not integrate MongoDB Atlas will not be eligible for final judging or prizes.

2. **Open Source**: Everything shown in the demo must be fully open source. This includes every component - backend, frontend, models, and any other parts of the project - published under an approved open source license.

3. **New Work Only**: All projects must be started from scratch during the hackathon with no previous work.

4. **Team Size**: Teams may have up to 4 members.

5. **Banned Projects**: Project will be disqualified if they: violate legal, ethical, or platform policies, use code, data, or assets you do not have the rights to.

### 🚫 Sample Anti-Projects to NOT DO — STRICTLY NO:

- Streamlit Applications
- AI Mental Health Advisor
- Trivial RAG Applications
- Basic Image Analyzers
- Entirely Promptable "AI for Education" Chatbot
- AI Job Application Screener
- AI Nutrition Coach
- Personality Analyzers
- Any project using AI to generate and give medical advice

## Problem Statements

**These are the required themes. Every project must build in one of these four themes.**

### Statement One: Prolonged Coordination

Create an agentic system capable of performing intricate, multi-step workflows that last hours or days, utilizing MongoDB as the context engine, while enduring failures, restarts, and modifications to tasks. How do you execute tool calls, retain reasoning state, recover from single failures, and ensure task consistency in multi-step tasks?

### Statement Two: Multi-Agent Collaboration

Develop a multi-agent system in which specialized agents explore, assign tasks, and communicate with one another, using MongoDB to organize and oversee contexts. How do agents convey their skills, identify suitable peers for a sub-task, share context effectively within token limits, and perform intricate tasks resulting from successful collaborations?

### Statement Three: Adaptive Retrieval

Create an agentic retrieval system that actively fetches from various resources (databases, search indices, multimodal sources, websites, etc.): modifying query approaches, altering chunking, reordering results based on input. How can you create an agentic and adaptive retrieval system that improves over time and performs reasoning across various documents and sources?

### Statement Four: Agentic Payments and Negotiation

Create agents capable of finding, negotiating, and purchasing services automatically through the x402 protocol. How can you create an agent that oversees a budget across various services, performs good-faith negotiation of price, evaluates service worth, manages payment errors smoothly, and reviews all financial choices in MongoDB?

## Judging & Submissions

Judging will proceed in three rounds. To be eligible for final judging and prizes, teams must participate in all three rounds and ensure their project uses MongoDB Atlas as a core component. Participation requires that at least one team member attend MongoDB.local SF and promote their project as outlined below.

### First Round - Saturday, January 10

First round judging will be taking place on Saturday, January 10. These judges are evaluating your technical demos in the following categories. Show us what you have built to solve our problem statements. Please do not show us a presentation. We'll be checking to ensure your project was built entirely during the event; no previous work is allowed.

**Submission**: Teams should submit when they have completed hacking. In the submission form, you will have to submit a short one minute demo video. This should be a video of what you have built, uploaded to Youtube, Loom, or somewhere else.

**Submission Link**: [Submit Project](https://cerebralvalley.ai/e/agentic-orchestration-hackathon/hackathon/submit)

#### Judging Criteria:

- **Impact (25%)** — What is the project's long-term potential for success, growth and impact? Does it fit into one of the problem statements listed above? Is the project useful, and for who?

- **Demo (50%)** — How well has the team implemented the idea? Does it work?

- **Creativity (15%)** — Is the project's concept innovative? Is their demo unique?

- **Pitch (10%)** — How effectively does the team present their project?

#### Judging Process:

- Hackers will be called to judging rooms, and seen by judges individually, ~3 minutes to pitch followed by 1-2 minutes of Q/A
- 6 finalist teams will be selected ("Finalists")
- The Finalists will demo to the hackathon attendees on stage after selection
- In the event that at least one team member from a Finalist is unable to attend MongoDB.local San Francisco, a backup team will be selected

### Second Round - MongoDB.local San Francisco - Community Vote January 15th, 2026

- The 6 Finalists will attend MongoDB.local, and each Finalist's demo will be displayed in Cerebral Valley's showcase area
- MongoDB.local attendees will be provided the opportunity to vote for their favourite project
- You will only be able to vote once
- The three Finalists that receive the greatest number of votes will proceed to the Final Round ("Final Three")

### Final Round - MongoDB.local Mainstage Presentation - January 15th, 2026

- The Final Three will be notified at 2:30PM and invited to present their demo live on stage at MongoDB.local, in front of the VIP judging panel and audience
- Finalists will have 3 minutes to present, with 3 minutes for Q&A

#### Judges will select the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners based on:

- **Impact** — What is the project's long-term potential for success, growth and impact? Does it fit into one of the problem statements listed above? Is the project useful, and for who?

- **Demo** — How well has the team implemented the idea? Does it work?

- **Creativity** — Is the project's concept innovative? Is their demo unique?
